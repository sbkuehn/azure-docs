# Welcome to Azure Defender for IoT for device builders

Operational technology (OT) networks power many of the most critical aspects of our society. But many of these technologies were not designed with security in mind and can't be protected with traditional IT security controls. Meanwhile, the Internet of Things (IoT) is enabling a new wave of innovation with billions of connected devices, increasing the attack surface and risk.  

Azure Defender for IoT is a unified security solution for identifying IoT/OT devices, vulnerabilities, and threats. It enables you to secure your entire IoT/OT environment, whether you need to protect existing IoT/OT devices or build security into new IoT innovations.  

Azure Defender for IoT offers two sets of capabilities to fit your environment's needs.

For end-user organizations with IoT/OT environments, Azure Defender for IoT delivers agentless, network-layer monitoring that:

- Can be rapidly deployed.
- Integrates easily with diverse industrial equipment and SOC tools.
- Has zero impact on IoT/OT network performance or stability. 

The platform can be deployed fully on-premises or in Azure-connected and hybrid environments.  

For IoT device builders, Azure Defender for IoT also offers lightweight a micro agent that supports standard IoT operating systems, such as Linux and RTOS. This lightweight agent helps ensure that security is built into your IoT/OT initiatives from the edge to the cloud. It includes source code for flexible, customizable deployment. 

## Agent-based solution 

Security is a near-universal concern for IoT implementers. IoT devices have unique needs for endpoint monitoring, security posture management, and threat detection â€“ all with highly specific performance requirements. 

The Azure Defender for IoT security agents allow you to build security directly into your new IoT devices and Azure IoT projects. The micro agent has flexible deployment options, including the ability to deploy as a binary package or modify source code. And the micro agent is available for standard IoT operating systems like Linux and Azure RTOS.  

The Azure Defender for IoT micro agent provides endpoint visibility into security posture management, threat detection, and integration into Microsoft's other security tools for unified security management. 

### Security posture management

Proactively monitor the security posture of your IoT devices. Azure Defender for IoT provides security posture recommendations based on the CIS benchmark, along with device-specific recommendations. Get visibility into operating system security, including OS configuration, firewall configuration, and permissions. 

### Endpoint IoT/OT threat detection

Detect threats like botnets, brute force attempts, crypto miners, and suspicious network activity. Create custom alerts to target the most important threats in your unique organization. 

### Flexible distribution and deployment models 

The Azure Defender for IoT micro agent includes source code, so you can incorporate the micro agent into firmware or customize it to include only what you need. It's also available as a binary package, or integrated directly into other Azure IoT solutions.
